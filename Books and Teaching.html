            In 2021 and 2022, <a href="https://www.karen-levy.net">Karen Levy</a> and I taught a new course entitled <a
                href="https://courses.cs.cornell.edu/cs1340/2022sp/">Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 /
                CS 1340)</a>. The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a
            range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.

                    This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled <a
                        href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/info2040_2017fa/">Networks</a>. The book, like the course,
                    is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper
                    explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.
